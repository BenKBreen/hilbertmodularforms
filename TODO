# High priority
- Test eigenforms (only one done)
- The number field or the HMFD should hold:
 * max_prec
 * list of ideals
 * list of representatives of the ideals
 * dicts: ideal --> coordinate(ideal) and repr --> coordinate(repr).
- The form gets the weight and not the space
- constant coefficient
- SetCoefficients( AssociativeArray --> coeffiencients);

# Medium priority
- Get and Set coeffiencients

# Low Priority
- Print should take an optional argument for the number of coeffs to print



# Wouldn't it be nice if
- we had tests and nice documentiation
