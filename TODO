# High priority
- Eisenstein series (Edgar and Musty)
- get basis, aka, new and old forms, for a given level (Edgar) Done?
- GetPosition line 153: ZF vs. Different showdown (Sam, Ben)
- implement over QQ for sanity checks using classical (Musty)
- Theta Series (Angie and Sara)
- Inversion (we most likely need truncated multiplication for this) (?Edgar)
- printing over QQ (Musty/Edgar)
- make recognition code great again (\strikethrough{Musty} Sam)


# Medium priority
- Test multiplication

# Low Priority


# Wouldn't it be nice if
- we had tests and nice documentation
