# High priority
- Making multiplication work for other fields
  - other quadratic fields
  - other fields

- Eisenstein series (Edgar and Musty)
  - testing

- Basis(M, weight);

- implement over QQ for sanity checks using classical (Musty)
  - printing over QQ (Musty/Edgar)

- Inversion (we most likely need truncated multiplication for this) (?Edgar)


# Medium priority
- Test multiplication for other fields not Q(sqrt(5))
- GetPosition line 153: ZF vs. Different showdown (Sam, Ben)

# Low Priority
- More tests for Theta Series (Angie and Sara)


# Wouldn't it be nice if
- we had tests and nice documentation
