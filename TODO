# High priority
- Making multiplication work for other fields
  - other nonquadratic fields

- Eisenstein series (Edgar and Musty)
  - change precision with the weight

- Save Space

- Basis(M, weight);
  - save to space
  - only works for level 1

- Higher narrow class numbers
  - Zeroth tests!
  - First multiplication
  Options:
    - constant coefficients are their own thing?
    - k-vectors ?


# Medium priority
- Test multiplication for other fields not Q(sqrt(5))
- GetPosition line 153: ZF vs. Different showdown (Sam, Ben)

# Low Priority
- More tests for Theta Series (Angie and Sara)


# Wouldn't it be nice if
- we had tests and nice documentation
