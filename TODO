# High priority
- Eisenstein series (Edgar and Musty)
- get basis, aka, new and old forms, for a given level (Edgar) Done?
- GetPosition line 153: ZF vs. Different showdown (Sam, Ben)
- implement over QQ for sanity checks using classical (Musty)
- Theta Series (Angie and Sara)
- Inversion (we most likely need truncated multiplication for this) (?Edgar)


# Medium priority
- add CoefficientParent(f);
- Test multiplication

# Low Priority

-Coercion such as M!0 for ModFrmHilDElts see classical code for examples
// what is the weight, 0??
//Fixme, should be a RngOrdElt
intrinsic '!'(M::ModFrmHilD, elt::RngElt) -> ModFrmHilDElt
{
  {returns f such that a_0 := c}
  coeffs := [0 : c in [1..Ideals(M)]];
  coeffs[0] := elt;
  return HMF(M, ????, coeffs);
end intrinsic;

# Wouldn't it be nice if
- we had tests and nice documentation
