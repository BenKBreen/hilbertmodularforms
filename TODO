# High priority
- The eigenform recursion is wrong, it's missing (Np)^(k-1) on the T^2
- Test eigenforms
- The number field or the HMFD should hold:
 * max_prec
 * list of ideals
 * list of representatives of the ideals
 * dicts: ideal --> coordinate(ideal) and repr --> coordinate(repr).
- The form gets the weight and not the space

# Medium priority
- Get and Set coeffiencients 

# Low Priority
- Print should take an optional argument for the number of coeffs to print



# Wouldn't it be nice if
- we had tests and nice documentiation
