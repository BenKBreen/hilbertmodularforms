# questions
- given space M and list of coeffs get precision of form
- coeffs should be a list right? then use the dictionary?
- what if 2 ideals have the same norm? what should the order be?

# High priority
- Test eigenforms (only one done)
- The number field or the HMFD should hold:
 * max_prec
 * list of ideals
 * list of representatives of the ideals
 * dicts: ideal --> coordinate(ideal) and repr --> coordinate(repr).
- The form gets the weight and not the space
- constant coefficient
- SetCoefficients( AssociativeArray --> coeffiencients);
- better equality functions for ModFrmHilD and ModFrmHilDElt
- Coercion such as M!0 for ModFrmHilDElts see classical code for examples

# Medium priority
- Get and Set coeffiencients

# Low Priority
- Print should take an optional argument for the number of coeffs to print



# Wouldn't it be nice if
- we had tests and nice documentiation
