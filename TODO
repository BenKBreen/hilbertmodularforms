# High priority
- get new and old forms for given level (Edgar)
- implement over QQ for sanity checks using classical (Musty)
- GetPosition line 153: ZF vs. Different showdown (Sam, Ben)
- Eisenstein series (Angie, Sara)
- Linear algebra (?Edgar)
- Inversion (we most likely need truncated multiplication for this) (?Edgar)


# Medium priority
Test multiplication

# Low Priority

-Coercion such as M!0 for ModFrmHilDElts see classical code for examples
// what is the weight, 0??
//Fixme, should be a RngOrdElt
intrinsic '!'(M::ModFrmHilD, elt::RngElt) -> ModFrmHilDElt

# Wouldn't it be nice if
- we had tests and nice documentation
