# High priority
- Multiplication table
- HMF( AssociativeArray --> coeffiencients);
- better equality functions for ModFrmHilD and ModFrmHilDElt
- Coercion such as M!0 for ModFrmHilDElts see classical code for examples
- Galois orbit...full orbit

# Medium priority
- Get coeffiencients
- Set one coefficient

# Low Priority
- Print should take an optional argument for the number of coeffs to print

# Wouldn't it be nice if
- we had tests and nice documentiation
