# High priority
- get new and old forms for given level
- implement over QQ for sanity checks using classical
- GetPosition line 153: ZF vs. Different showdown
- Eisentstein series
- Inversion (we most likely need truncated multiplication for this)
- Linear algebra


# Medium priority
Test multiplication

# Low Priority

-Coercion such as M!0 for ModFrmHilDElts see classical code for examples
// what is the weight, 0??
//Fixme, should be a RngOrdElt
intrinsic '!'(M::ModFrmHilD, elt::RngElt) -> ModFrmHilDElt
{
  {returns f such that a_0 := c}
  coeffs := [0 : c in [1..Ideals(M)]];
  coeffs[0] := elt;
  return HMF(M, ????, coeffs);
end intrinsic;

# Wouldn't it be nice if
- we had tests and nice documentation
