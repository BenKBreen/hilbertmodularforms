# High priority
- GetPosition line 153: ZF vs. Different showdown
- better equality functions for ModFrmHilDElt (Done?)

# Medium priority
Test multiplication

# Low Priority

-Coercion such as M!0 for ModFrmHilDElts see classical code for examples
// what is the weight ???
//Fixme, should be a RngOrdElt

# Wouldn't it be nice if
- we had tests and nice documentiation
